      - name: Checkout repository

      # 2. Set up Node.js environment

          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: "npm" # Enable caching for npm dependencies to speed up subsequent runs

      # 3. Install dependencies
      # Using 'npm ci' is generally recommended for CI as it's faster and more reliable for clean installs based on package-lock.json

        run: npm install

      # 4. Run your tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test # This will execute "jest" as per your package.json
